Several algorithms on ogonek take ranges of code points as input. Some classes
in the standard libary can be used as ranges of code points: containers like
`std::vector<ogonek::code_point>` or `std::u32string`. However those aren't
always useful since they don't allow the use of other encodings for storing the
data. Ogonek provides a generic class template named `text` to create ranges of
codepoints with various underlying encodings.

### Custom encoding

The interface of `text` exposes iteration over code points for use in the
algorithms, but the data is stored using some known encoding. This way one can
use the algorithms with data in any encoding.

The encoding can be customized by changing the first template parameter. Being
part of the type helps the compiler ensures the right conversions occur at the
right places.

*Example*:
{% highlight cpp %}
using utf8_text = ogonek::text<ogonek::utf8>;
using utf16_text = ogonek::text<ogonek::utf16>;
{% endhighlight %}

### Custom storage

The class also allows customization of the underlying storage, by means of the
second template parameter. Any container can be used to store the data. The
default storage used is a `std::basic_string` instantiated with the encoding's
code unit.

*Example*:
{% highlight cpp %}
using utf8_deque = ogonek::text<ogonek::utf8, std::deque<ogonek::utf8::code_unit>;
using latin1_vector = ogonek::text<ogonek::latin1, std::vector<char>>;
{% endhighlight %}

### Interop aliases

There are two aliases defined for easy interop: `posix_text` and `windows_text`.
The former uses UTF-8 and `std::string`, while the latter uses UTF-16 and
`std::wstring`.

*Example*:
{% highlight cpp %}
ogonek::windows_text message { u"Hello World!" };
ogonek::windows_text caption { u"Ogonek" };
::MessageBox(hwnd, message.storage().data(), caption.storage().data(), MB_OK);
{% endhighlight %}

There is also a `native_text` alias that is equal to `windows_text` if
`OGONEK_WINDOWS` is defined, or to `posix_text` if `OGONEK_POSIX` is defined
instead.

### Constructors

`text` instances can be constructed from a variety of sources.

Blah blah incomplete.
