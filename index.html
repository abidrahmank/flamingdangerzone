<h3>Exploring C++11</h3>

<p>The C++ language has evolved. A bunch of new features were added to it in 2011.
Gradually, compilers are adding support for them. And programmers can now start
exploring these features, learning both their power and their limitations.</p>

<p>In this series of articles I document what I learned in my own explorations of the
language, both on my own and with the help of others.</p>
