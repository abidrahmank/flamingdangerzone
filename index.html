<h3>Exploring C++11</h3>

<p>The C++ language has evolved. A bunch of new features were added to it in 2011.
Gradually, compilers are adding support for them. And programmers can now start
exploring these features, learning both their power and their limitations.</p>

<p>In this series of articles I document what I learned in my own explorations of the
language, both on my own and with the help of others.</p>

<h3>C++ tutorials</h3>

<p>Low quality C++ tutorials are a dime a dozen on the web. This series of
tutorials is my attempt of raising the quality of the average C++ tutorial. All
tutorials assume previous programming experience with an imperative or
object-oriented language. The tutorials are not intended to act as the sole
source the reader uses to learn C++. I recommend a good book, the C++ FAQ, and
Stack Overflow as additional sources.</p>

<p>In <a href="/tutorials/00-why.html">another article</a>I explain why I think
my tutorials are not like the average C++ tutorial, which you can read if you
are curious.</p>

<ul>

<h3>C++ libraries</h3>

<p>I have written some C++ libraries that others might find useful. The
documentation for those libraries can be found here.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/doc/wheels/index.html">Wheels</a> &raquo; a collection of small
      general purpose components.</li>
<!--
  <li><a href="/doc/rtl/index.html">Range Template Library</a> &raquo; an
      implementation of Andrei Alexandrescu's range concepts;</li>
  <li><a href="/doc/ogonek/index.html">Ogonek</a> &raquo; an Unicode handling
      library with C++ idioms.</li>
-->
</ul>
