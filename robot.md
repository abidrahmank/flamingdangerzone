title: About R. Martinho Fernandes

### In meatspace

I am a young man from Portugal who chose to make a living writing software. I
currently live and work in Berlin.

I divide my free time between blogging, hobby programming projects, reading
science fiction books, hanging out with friends, playing boardgames, speedcubing,
exploring interesting places, and cycling around Berlin.

### In cyberspace

I am a carnivore programming robot.

As most denizens of the Internet, I can be reached via email; the address [random@rmf.io][email]
can be used for that. I am usually happy to reply to e-mail messages that look
like they were crafted specifically to be sent to me. Anything that looks like
a template that is sent to several people, I tend to dismiss.

As many open-source programmers, I have a user account on GitHub, where my
projects are hosted. On there I am [rmartinho][github].

I also have a [Twitter account][twitter]; I mostly use it to read and discover
interesting stuff, which I sometimes retweet. On rare occasions I also tweet
something of my own creation.

I was once a somewhat regular contributor on [Stack Overflow][so]. I started by
contributing to the C# and .NET tags, and then shifted more towards the C++ and
C++11 tags, and later my activity gradually declined over the years.

On Keybase, I am [rmf][keybase]. There you can find a cryptographic public key
for which I possess the corresponding private key. I have used that key to prove
that this website, my GitHub account, and my Twitter account all belong to
someone in possession on that key. I also keep a copy of that public key at https://rmf.io/rmf.key.

### What's in a name?

As is common among Portuguese I have two given names and two family names. For
succintness I omit my second given name and my first family name in all but the
most formal contexts. In most informal situations I use only my first given
name.

My full name is *Martinho Filipe Dias Fernandes*; *Martinho* and *Filipe* are my
given names; *Dias* and *Fernandes* are my family names.

I pronounce my first name as [mɐɾˈtiɲ&#x31f;u]. Almost all of those phonemes
should be easy to pronounce for an English speaker.

The sole exception is [ɲ&#x31f;]. It's an alveolo-palatal nasal consonant.
Similar consonants show up in various languages, but not in English. It's
pronounced like 〈ñ〉 in Spanish; like 〈gn〉 in French or Italian; like 〈ń〉
in Polish; 〈ny〉 in Hungarian and Indonesian; 〈nj〉 in various Balkan
languages; 〈ň〉 in Czech and Slovak; 〈nn〉 in some Irish dialects; 〈rn〉 in
Norwegian; sometimes 〈νι〉 in Modern Greek; or like 〈nh〉 in Occitan and
Vietnamese.

People I've met often pronounce that last syllable as [nu]. That is wrong; you
can't just pretend the 〈h〉 isn't there. Others end up pronouncing the last
syllable like the English word "new" in a UK dialect, [njuː]. That's probably
the closest I can expect anyone to get using only English phonemes.

My second name I pronounce [fi'lip]. That's almost the same "Philip" in English,
but with stress on the second syllable instead of the first one. "Dias" is also
easy for English speakers. I pronounce it ['diɐʃ]. The esh, 〈ʃ〉, is like
〈sh〉 in English.

My last name I pronounce [fəɾ'nandəʃ], sometimes with the schwas, [ə], really
short.

Following Portuguese naming tradition, my first family name is my mother's last
family name, and my last family name is my father's last family name. By
coincidence, my mother's first family name is the same as my last family name,
so my family names are exactly the same as my mother's but in opposite orders.

As with all *Homo sapiens* specimina at the time of this writing, I was born on the
planet Terra, on the planetary system of the star Sol. I grew up on a small
village on that same planet named Prozelo. My [Culture] name is thus
*Sol-Terrasa Martinho-Filipe Robot Dias-Fernandes dam Prozelo*, with *Robot*
being my chosen name. Lacking any information about how to deal with multiple
given names or multiple family names in Culture names I chose to join them with
hyphens. The hyphens have no effect on pronounciation.

In cyberspace I go by a name constructed by adding the prefix "R." to my
shortened meatspace name with one given name and one family name as described
above. That prefix is an allusion to Isaac Asimov's fictional future society,
where robots are named similar to humans, but with an "R." prefix which stands
for "Robot"; [*R. Daneel Olivaw*][rdaneel] is the most famous character named
with this convention.

My first given name, *Martinho*, comes from the Latin name *Martinus*, itself
derived from the name of the Roman god of war, [Mars]. There are cognates in most
European languages; the English cognate is *Martin*.

 [Mars]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_(mythology)

"Warlike" is the meaning usually attributed to the name *Martinus*; I find that
a rather erroneous description of my persona. Instead I prefer the idea that I
share my name with one of the first conscientious objectors, [Martinus
Turonensis], known as Saint Martin of Tours in the Christian faith.

 [Martinus Turonensis]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_of_Tours

Martinus was was a soldier in the Roman army deployed in Gaul. One day he met a
scantily clad beggar near Amiens and cut his cloak in half to share it with the
beggar. Later that night he dreamed of [Jesus] wearing the half he gave away and
that lead to him joining the Christian faith. Finding his duty as a soldier
incompatible with his newfound faith, he become a conscientious objector.

My second given name, *Filipe*, comes from the Greek *Φίλιππος* (*Philippos*), a
compound of φίλος (*phílos*, meaning "friend") and ἵππος (*hippos*, meaning
"horse"); a straightforward translation would be "friend of horses". Again, most
European languages have cognates for this name; the English cognate is *Philip*.

The origin of my first family name, *Dias*, is a bit harder to pinpoint and
there are various theories around. The Spanish cognate *Diaz* may be a
patronymic of *Diego*, itself derived from the name of the biblical figure
[Jacob] (יַעֲקֹב), leading to the meaning of "son of Jacob". The offspring of the
sons of Jacob became the tribes of Israel after [the Exodus].

 [the Exodus]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exodus

In Modern Greek, the Ancient Greek god [Zeus] is named *Δίας*, and the Latin
alphabet transliteration is *Días*.

My last family name, *Fernandes*, is a patronymic of *Fernando*, which comes
from the Germanic name *Ferdinand* through the Visigothic influence in the
Iberian peninsula in the Early Middle Ages. The original meaning of the Germanic
name is "adventurous journey".

Coincidentally, *Fernandes* is the family name I took from my father and it is a
patronymic of *Fernando* which is my father's given name.
