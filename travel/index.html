  <p>
  I learned to ride a bicycle when I was more than twelve years old. Some years
  later I moved to the city and kind of forgot about my bicycle. Even more years
  later I moved to Berlin and&mdash;oh my, bicycles everywhere.
  </p>

  <p>
  Eventually I acquired a bicycle to displace myself across Berlin and with that
  came a new-found liking for cycling.

  <p>
  And then I decided to experiment a bit with writing about my cycling
  expeditions.
