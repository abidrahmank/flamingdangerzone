As the plot of *The City & The City* unravels, we get to see how people, Borlú
in particular, describe how Breach appears and operates. We are told that they
show up out of nowhere, are somewhat indistinct shapes or something in that
ballpark. There's a pervasive feeling that Breach is close to omniscient and
omnipresent. Not something that is easy to justify physically.

However, Borlú later realises how very few make up Breach, and gets a glimpse
of how they operate. Pretty much everything he witnesses is somewhat "normal".
They coordinate their efforts with cellphones and they use the Internet to
obtain information (even though they have seemingly magical cracking skills).
No omnipresence, no omniscience. If I recall correctly Tyador never witnesses
anything supernatural while interacting with Breach. It's like they're just
normal dudes that have a really weird job.

They use confounding styles and mannerisms that can be interpreted as both Besź
an Ul Qoman in order to achieve their invisibility and to be able to show out
of nowhere. They are not invisible; merely unseen by both cities.

There are a few things that irk me in this reading. There's the weird gun that
Tyador never figures out. Maybe it is just some strange prototype that Breach
has access to. It uses some technology (or magic according to Clarke's Law) to
incapacitate its targets.

There's the forgotten past wars fought by Breach that no one knows about. I can
somehow accept Breach managing to erase some events from collective memory in
the past, but it's hard to accept that in the modern day. With the Internet
around, who will ever forget the riots that take place in the events described
in the book? Can their seemingly-magical sway over the Internet ("Go anywhere
you want") erase those?

I like to think that they can't.

If Breach is this very elaborate construct that has no supernatural component,
it casts the entire setting of *The City and the City* in a completely different
light. A non-supernatural Breach is a bit harder to accept as the centuries old
entity that it is, but I am willing to stretch my suspension of disbelief to
accept that in exchange for a setting I like even more.

I like to think that the riots that take place by the end of the novel will
have lasting repercussions in lives of the citizens and the citizens.
"Information wants to free". In the end, I think the ubiquity of information
will overthrow Breach. It will be a painful process, but the psychological border
between Besźel and Ul Qoma will disappear.
