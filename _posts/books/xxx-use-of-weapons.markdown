*Use of Weapons*, by Iain M. Banks, is the third novel in the Culture series,
after *Consider Phlebas* and *The Player of Games*. Having enjoyed the first two
I started *Use of Weapons* expecting some more enjoyable reading.

The first thing that I feel the need to mention is the narrative structure of
the book. We are told two stories, part of one larger story that is the
life of the book's protagonist, Cheradenine Zakalwe. These two stories are
interwoven in alternating chapters, and move in opposite temporal directions.
The main narrative is told moving forward in time; the backward moving chapters
tell us of events in Zakalwe's earlier life. To further complicate matters, some
of the backward moving chapters involve characters having flashbacks of even
older events; and both the prologue and the epilogue are both set after the
events of the main story.

Cheradenine is a warrior that has done several jobs for the Culture in the past,
under the direction of Diziet Sma, an agent from Special Circumstances, the
Culture's secret service organization. The main narrative tells us how Diziet
got him back from exile in order to do one last job, how Zakalwe performed that
job, and what he wanted as payment for it.

The biographic narrative tells us important events of Zakalwe's earlier life,
including some of the previous jobs he did for the Culture.
