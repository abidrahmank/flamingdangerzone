I like to travel.

When I say "to travel" I don't mean to visit places. I don't mean to be in
places. I mean to travel; I mean the part when you are actually moving from one
point to another, not the parts when you are at those endpoints.

I usually explain what I mean by explaining how traveling on a plane doesn't
count. Planes are boring: you get into the metal can and then a few hours later
you're elsewhere.  With a plane you cannot appreciate the act of traveling
itself; you can only appreciate that part when you are someplace. The part when
you travel to that place is boring and incredibly short.

It's a bit like non-instantaneous teleportation. You go from one point to
another without actually crossing the intervening space. Well, technically, you
do cross that intervening space, but you don't really experience it. It's a bit
like the fast travel mechanic of some video games, with the difference that
usually video games require you to manually cross the intervening space at least
once before you can just hop between places without experiencing the intervening
space.

I have traveled between points of the planet that are more than two thousand
kilometres apart, but the distance between them is meaningless. Those two points
are something between two and three hours apart, not two thousand kilometres.
In this context, their distance can only be meaningfully expressed in hours, not
kilometres. The engineer in me wants to punch myself for those last two
sentences, but the me that actually traveled between those points wants to slap
the engineer for not getting the point.

On a plane, the intervening space becomes the intervening time; the space is
reduced to the plane itself.

I like the intervening space.
