Hondsiep was the name of the place; a small Shell station near the Dutch-German
border. We were there for almost three hours unsuccessfully trying to get a
ride. Our signs read "Amsterdam", but after an hour and a half, we went for any
settlement where we could find a place to sleep. We had tried several spots
between the fuel pumps and the exit into the highway, and eventually decided to
just stand by the pumps holding a sign for Nijmegen, which seemed to be the
closest bout of civilisation.

Our wait ended when this Dutch woman approached us and asked if we wanted a
ride to Nijmegen, first in Dutch, and then in English after realising we didn't
understand a word of Dutch. Federica and her husband were returning home after
golfing and the car was full of golf equipment. We managed to arrange the clubs
in the backseat so we could barely fit, and they brought us to Nijmegen.

They were very friendly; they told us a lot about Nijmegen, and a few things
about Amsterdam. They even dropped us off by a nice hostel in Nijmegen. Despite
the golf clubs sharing the backseat with us, that was a rather pleasant
15-minute trip.

And there we were, standing in front of a hostel in Nijmegen. Two guests were
just getting in as we stood there; we followed them in and found the reception.
Empty. It was about twenty past ten, and the hostel closed at ten. We had been
lucky to have gotten in because those guests we followed had a key to unlock the
front door.

We didn't give up, though. Joep, the person running the hostel, had left his
phone number by the reception desk for guests to call if they needed to; we saw
that and decided to ring him. He was not annoyed at all by our late call asking
for a room. Five minutes later he was in the hostel, booked our rooms, gave us a
map of town, and told us about all the interesting places around, including the
official hitchhiking spot. We dropped our bags in our room and went out to
explore Nijmegen.

Sometime around eleven the morning after we went to the hitchhiking spot and
got our thumbs out again. The spot was right before the bridge leading out of
town and had ample space for cars to stop and pick us up.

We got a ride in about half an hour. The driver stopped by the wayside some
hundred metres past us, and we didn't notice until some gardeners nearby called
us out and pointed at the stopped car.
