I woke up. To the left, Krzysztof still driving; in the back seat, Yimu still
sleeping. I wondered where we were. *Probably still in Germany*, I thought. Then
it hit me that I was in a stranger's car, whereabouts unknown, and hundreds of
miles from anyone I had ever met. *I met Yimu three months ago. Does that
count?*

Despite the sudden realisation of alienness, I didn't feel apprehensive.
Krzysztof seemed to be a nice chap. He told us about his family and even showed
me a picture of his wife. His down-to-earth attitude, his openness, and the
exciting feeling of adventure overcame any anxiety I might feel from being in an
unfamiliar environment.

I didn't speak. Krzysztof was focused on his driving, and I decided to think
about the events of that day so far.
