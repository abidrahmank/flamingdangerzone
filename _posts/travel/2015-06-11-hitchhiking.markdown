I woke up. To the left, Krzysztof still driving; in the back seat, Yimu still
sleeping. I wondered where we were. *Probably still in Germany*, I thought. Then
it hit me that I was in a stranger's car, whereabouts unknown, and hundreds of
miles from anyone I had ever met. *I met Yimu three months ago. Does that
count?*

Despite the sudden realisation of alienness, I didn't feel apprehensive.
Krzysztof seemed to be a nice chap. He told us about his family and even showed
me a picture of his wife. His down-to-earth attitude, his openness, and the
exciting feeling of adventure overcame any anxiety I might feel from being in an
unfamiliar environment.

I didn't speak. Krzysztof was focused on his driving, and I started to think
about the events of that day so far.

We left the bar at 5am. The original plan was to start off in the early
afternoon, but Sumi convinced Yimu to head off *now*. We stopped by our
respective homes to sort out some kind of travel backpack, got ourselves on a
train to Michendorf, and walked to a service station by the Berliner Ring
highway, hoping to get ourselves a ride to the Bundesautobahn 2.

Once at the service station, we worked to produce some signs. Yimu broke into
the closed garbage compound and took two sheets of cardboard from the paper trash
container. I wrote the names of several cities on our way on them: Madgeburg,
Hannover, Dortmund, and then our intended target, Amsterdam. With our freshly
made hitchhiker tools, we sat down in front of the fuel pumps with the signs
propped up by our feet.

And there we sat, staring at the drivers as they filled their tanks, hoping one
of them would gift us a few hundred kilometres, out of shee&mdash;

*Out of what? What drives someone to pick up a hitchhiker?*, I asked myself,
interrupting my recollection. *Maybe they hitchhiked before and do it out of a
sense of reciprocation? Or they enjoy having company while driving hundreds of
kilometres? Or they're just as silly as I am; I'd totally pick up a hitchhiker
just for the experience. Or...*

I looked at Krzysztof once more and started thinking up unhealthy reasons for
him to pick us up and drive us as far as he did without showing any sign of ill
intentions. Back then I was reading *Under the Skin*, a story where the
protagonist drives around Scotland picking up hitchhikers and doing bad things
to them. With that in mind, I couldn't help but wonder if any of our helpful
drivers might have less than good intentions.

*Nah, there's no reason Krzysztof would pick us up, go out of the way to drop
off that other guy, and then get back on the highway for miles and miles if he
had ill intentions; it's just stupid*, I assured myself. *Hah, that other
guy... that was not what I was expecting when I thought about meeting fellow
hitchhikers.*

Krzysztof had picked us up at a small service station some ten miles before
Brunswick. A fellow hitchhiker had joined us there, on his way to Kassel. I am
still unsure whether I can count that one as a hitchhiker. We found him at the
gas station sitting by the air pumps. He lacked a sign, but had all the looks of
expecting to hitch a ride. Yet, he didn't even approach any drivers passing by
to pump their tires. He just sat there. When we talked to him, he told us he had
been there since the day before, and couldn't get a ride. When we told him he
should have a sign, he produced his from a back pocket: a flimsy A4 sheet of
paper with "Kassel" written on it.

I wanted to laugh but held back. Our signs were cardboard squares about 70cm
wide, folded in three, with different city names written in big capitals with a
red marker on each of the three outward facing sides. Compared to his flimsy A4
sheet with a barely readable "Kassel" in it, our signs made it look like we were
professionals. When we were not thumbing, we carried them around on the outside
of our backpacks; some people at that service station had noticed them on our
backpacks and approached us with potential ride offers. Despite our null
experience, having a sign that signals properly had always been on our minds as
a very important thing for winning rides, and it was hard to understand why this
guy wasn't even bothering to hold his up.

He didn't really seem interested in taking our advice, so we left him to his own
devices and went to get some food at McDonald's, the only eating option
available at that station. After that meal, we went back to thumbing, and that
was when Krzysztof picked us up. As we were entering his car, the Kassel guy ran
over and asked if he could join. Krzysztof was kind enough to take him in as
well; Kassel wasn't far and more or less along the way Krzysztof was going. At
least that's what he determined after glancing at his foldable map of Germany.

Krzysztof had no navigator, not even a simple GPS receiver. He always checked
his route by looking at road signs and quickly glancing at the map. He sorted
out a detour from the highway to avoid a traffic jam around Hannover, and at the
same time to drop off that other guy at Kassel with ten seconds of looking at
his map. That was truly impressive.

Yimu woke up and asked where we were. Krzysztof told him we were near Dortmund,
but Yimu had no idea where that was. He cheered when I explained that it was not
too far from the Netherlands.

The three of us chatted in our three differently broken brands of German for a
while. Krzysztof told us about his work as a truck driver in Eindhoven, and
about his family in Poland and we told him about our lives in Berlin. At some
point the conversation steered into politics and the hardships of trying to
live with minimum wage in Poland, and then it eventually died off and we were
back to Krzysztof driving in silence while people on the radio kept talking
about something in Dutch.

The Dutch border was, as expected, very unceremonial. The only indication that
we were crossing a border was the usual blue sign with the European Union stars
and the name of the country. Yimu actually missed it and asked how long it would
take to get to the Netherlands about half an hour after we crossed the border.
Soon after, Krzysztof had to drop us off and head towards Eindhoven. He had
brought us almost all the way across Germany, and we gave him a six-pack of beer
we had bought at a service station earlier. He felt the need to reciprocate, and
gave us each a can of some Polish beer, which we stored in our backpacks for
later.

He left us at a gas station some fifteen minutes south of the city of Nijmegen at
around seven o'clock, and after using the bathroom there, we went back to
thumbing, hoping to get a ride to Amsterdam.

After a fruitless hour and a half of that, we decided it was time to change
plans. Amsterdam was some two hours away, and we were not expecting much luck
getting a ride there after eight-thirty. The chances of finding someone headed
fifteen minutes away willing to give us a ride seemed much better. Once in
Nijmegen we could find a hostel to spend the night and resume our journey the
day after.

And so we wrote "Nijmegen" on my sign, and resumed our thumbing efforts...
