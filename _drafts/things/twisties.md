When I was twelve I got my hands on a Rubik's cube. The thing quickly consumed a
significant portion of my free time. It was impossible to put it down, to give
up on the quest to find out its secrets. It took me a month or so to discover
some useful tricks. There was no ubiquituous Internet access back then&mdash;I
didn't even have a computer&mdash;so I couldn't just look up how to solve the
thing. I had to figure out how it worked on my own. I took it to school and for
three months or so it was what I spent my free time with.

Eventually I solved it.
