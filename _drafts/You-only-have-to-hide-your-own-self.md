### "Anonymous"

The "anonymous" in "anonymous data collection" only means the data is not tagged with your name. The amount needed to discriminate your data from someone else's is surprisingly low. A [Columbia University study][study] has shown that a mere two geotagged posts can be used to uniquely identify you. "Anonymous" means "we don't tag your data with your name, because we don't need it". It means your name is mostly useless for the collector's purposes, *but the rest is not*. The name is just an identifier, a signature. A couple of posts with geotags is but one example of an equivalent signature for many purposes.

### Where are you?

![Google Maps being sneaky][share location]

Google tricks people into sharing their location. If you use Google Maps, you are asked if you accept sharing your location data "anonymously" with Google, at *any time* even when not using Google Maps. You can accept or decline. You can mark a box to remember your choice so you don't get asked again. Mark that box and the decline option is no longer enabled. Ok, they say they use the data to improve their services, but that's no excuse for this user-hostile behaviour. I should be able to decline and never be bothered again. Instead I have the choice of declining every single time or accepting it and never being bothered again. Maybe I'll accidentally accept it someday, or maybe I'll have enough of it and just accept it so they don't bug me anymore. I just want to user their damn maps that don't even work offline. As the user, I benefit nothing from this and I get constant annoyance.

### Analytics

Google Analytics is everywhere. It's a tool that website owners can use to gather statistics on site visitors, in order to find out what your audience is, and how they find your site, and stuff like that. It works as a script provided by Google that runs on every page of your website, monitors your activity, and sends that data to Google's servers. The website owners can then look up the data for their websites from Google. The audience is completely unaware of this. Google provides an opt-out which consists of installing a browser extension. Note that this tracks you whether you have a Google account or not. It's also "anonymous".

### Likes

Facebook has a similar deal going on. Websites put Like buttons on their page. These buttons are served straight from Facebook servers so Facebook knows where you've been when the page loads the button. Even if you're not logged in, this information is not useless, because that only means it is "anonymous".

### Content filtering

Facebook filters and orders the content they show you. This is no secret. The official word is that they want to provide you with the content that is important to you. In order to provide this, they need to find what that content might be. They do this by using the data they collect to build a profile of you. This includes your browsing activity collected from the Like buttons and also the way you browse Facebook, including seemingly innocuous things like scrolling. It is no secret that they track when you stop scrolling and how long you stop over some post and this tells them what tickles your fancy *even if you don't interact with the post*. Just because you never mentioned something that interests you, it doesn't mean their algorithms cannot infer that. Hiding your preferences requires more than silence. It requires *ignoring your preferences* too.

### Moods

Facebook is known to have conducted experiments with their [content filtering and its influence on people's moods][moods]. For a week they served a higher number of posts deemed positive to a group of users, and a higher number of posts deemed negative to another. The first group generated more positive posts; the second more negative posts. Official word is that experiments like this were done to improve the service.

### What if?

Get to grips with these facts and now bear with me through some speculation.

Suppose Facebook prefers that Alice win an election, because Bob, who is running against Alice, wants to impose measures that Facebook deems unfavourable to them. They have profiles of their users and know who is more likely to vote for Alice and who is more likely to vote for Bob.

Suppose there is a nationwide campaign to increase general turnout in order to make the election more representative. There will be content from this campaign doing the rounds on Facebook.

Now, suppose that Facebook uses their content filtering to bias the serving of the turnout campaign predominantly to Alice supporters.

They could influence the election by disproportionately increasing turnout among Alice supporters.

### Really?

Now, if you accept that this is possible, let us look closely at what this means.

First, note that this requires no new infrastructure. Everything is already in place: large user base, user profiling, and content filtering exist in today's Facebook.

Second, this requires nothing like an evil government or a dictatorship. It can be played out even in a fully democratic system.

Third, this is essentially a large scale version of the mood experiments Facebook conducted, with results that are not relatively harmless.

This implies that, unless you simply trust Facebook to not do anything of the sort, *you have something to hide*. In this scenario, whether you support Bob or not is something you want to hide, otherwise you'll just be a cog in the machine.

You have something to hide that is perfectly legal and even perfectly ethical and moral. You want to hide your political views even in a fully democratic system.

But you can't hide them. All it takes is serving you some random or not-so-random content related to Alice and Bob, and a bit of profiling from your reaction to them even if the reaction is just scrolling through them slower or faster.

You have so much to hide that you even have to hide your own scrolling patterns.
