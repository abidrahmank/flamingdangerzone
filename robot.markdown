title: About R. Martinho Fernandes

### In meatspace

I am a young man from Portugal that chose to make a living writing software.
In meatspace my name does not have an "R." at the beginning. I currently live
and work in Berlin.

I divide my free time between blogging, hobby programming projects, reading
science fiction books, hanging out with friends, and walking around Berlin.

### In cyberspace

I am a carnivore programming robot. Sometimes I go by the nickname "the Robot",
and that's what the R. honourific in my cyberspace name stands for.
It is [an allusion][rdaneel] to Isaac Asimov's fictional future society.

I am a semi-regular contributor at [Stack Overflow][so]. I started by contributing
to the C# and .NET tags, and nowadays I contribute mostly on the C++ and C++11 tags.

I have a [Twitter account][twitter]; I mostly use it to read and discover
interesting stuff, which I sometimes retweet. On rare occasions I also tweet
something of my own creation.
