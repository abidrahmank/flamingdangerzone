title: About Flaming Dangerzone
---

*Flaming Dangerzone* is the personal website of [R. Martinho Fernandes][about me]. It started
as a blog for documenting the exploration of the C++11 language, but with time other things
made their home here.

The title of the website was picked randomly by the GitHub Pages service, and the author found
it was a good title for a blog about C++.

### Technical details

The website is hosted by the [GitHub Pages][pages] service. All pages are served statically; 
no content generation is performed on the server. The static pages are generated by the Jekyll
engine running on GitHub Pages from a mix of Markdown and HTML [sources].
